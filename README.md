# AuralMind

**THIS PROJECT IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT**

AuralMind is a Python-based voice recognition and response system designed as the auditory module of a future comprehensive virtual assistant framework. Inspired by the complexity and versatility of advanced systems like Jarvis, AuralMind focuses on the auditory interaction - recognizing spoken commands, processing them through basic natural language understanding, and providing spoken responses. This project serves as a modular foundation for developers aiming to build sophisticated, AI-driven assistants that mimic human senses and cognitive functions.

## Features

- **Voice Recognition**: Converts spoken language into text using Google's Speech Recognition API.
- **Simple NLP**: Understands basic commands and questions, laying the groundwork for more advanced natural language processing.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Provides audible responses to commands and questions, using pyttsx3 for speech synthesis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you can run AuralMind, make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. Additionally, you'll need to install several dependencies:

```bash
pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 PyAudio spacy
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/r00tn3tsage/AuralMind.git
cd AuralMind

#### Usage

To start the AuralMind assistant, run:
python auralmind.py

Speak into your microphone to give commands or ask questions. AuralMind will respond to simple commands like “hello” or “how are you”.

#### Contributing

Contributions to AuralMind are welcome! Whether it’s through submitting bug reports, offering suggestions for new features, or contributing to the code, we value your input.
